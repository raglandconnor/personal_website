                    This app was created as a personal project to test my React
                    abilities and also to make a productivity tool that combined
                    different tools I already use.

                <p className="mb-4 md:mx-24">
                    In the app, there is a pomodoro timer that can use custom
                    intervals, as well as a todo list that has countdown timers
                    for each task.

                <p className="mb-4 md:mx-24">
                    I have found that countdowns help me get tasks done sooner,
                    so I wanted to incorporate that into the app.
